# Pearl - Mindfulness and Meditation

My first big project built on Flutter without following a course.

Altough the code is super ugly ( I plan to work on that ), I'm super proud of what I did.

This hands-on helped me to understand a lot better Flutter and Dart, improve my problem solving skills and software development in general, if I was just following a course I believe that it would be much more difficult, so has I said, event though the horrible code organization I'm really happy how it turned out.
